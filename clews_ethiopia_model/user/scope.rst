===========

The CLEWs-Ethiopia model is a linear optimisation model. 
It uses a cost minimisation approach to identify the system configuration 
with the lowest cost over a model horizon, subject to a set of constraints.
Below is a summary of the model scope:


**Sectors:** Land, energy, water

**Time resolution:** 6 timeslices

**Time horizon:** 2019-2030 

**Spatial resolution:** 10 regions represented as 21 'clusters'
