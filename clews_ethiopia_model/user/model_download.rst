The CLEWs-Ethiopia model is free to download, use, and modify. 
The entire model, comprising a baseline and several scenarios, 
is available for download here: 
https://github.com/abhishek0208/clews_ethiopia_model/blob/master/user/files/osemosys_ETH_23-09-2020.zip

A user interface is required to view, run, or modify the CLEWs-Ethiopia model.
MoManI, the interface used to build the model, can be downloaded for free from here:
http://www.osemosys.org/get-started.html

The above page includes instructions to download MoManI and upload models.

The modelled scenarios can be run, and results interactively visualised, 
on an online OSeMOSYS cloud-computing platform: https://www.osemosys-cloud.com/  
The platform requires an account to be set up (free) before it can be used.

Below are the steps required to run a specific scenario in the 
CLEWs-Ethiopia model:

- On MoManI, click on the CLEWs-Ethiopia model
- Click `Download executable` for the desired scenario. This will start a download of a .zip file.
- Unzip the file from the previous step. It will contain 4 files: `data.txt`, `model.txt`, `metadata.txt`, and `RunSimulation.exe`
- The OSeMOSYS cloud-computing platform requires two files: a model file and a data file. The link to the model file is below and `data.txt` from the previous step will be the data file

The model file: https://github.com/abhishek0208/clews_ethiopia_model/blob/master/user/files/model_new_modecost.txt

.. Note:: The model file will remain the same for all scenarios while the data file will be specific to each scenario.
